### Patch Changes

- d407468: Fix stale internal dependency versions in published packages.

  `bun publish` resolves a `workspace:*` dependency to the version recorded in
  `bun.lock`, not the bumped `package.json` version. `ci:version` ran
  `bun install --lockfile-only`, which does not re-resolve workspace references, so
  the lockfile kept the previous version — `@vui-rs/vue@0.1.1` and `@vui-rs/ui@0.1.1`
  published with `@vui-rs/core` pinned to `0.1.0` (the unimportable build), making
  them fail to install. `ci:version` now runs `bun update` so the lockfile resolves
  internal deps to the current versions before publish.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0dde4a2: Fix unimportable published packages by pointing `exports`/`module`/`types` at `dist/`.

  Each package previously kept `exports` at `./src/index.ts` for in-repo dev and
  relied on a `publishConfig` block to swap in the `dist/` paths at publish. But
  `bun publish` (used so `workspace:`/`catalog:` protocols get resolved) does not
  apply the `publishConfig` overlay the way `npm publish` does, so the published
  manifests shipped the `src/` paths while the tarball contained only `dist/` —
  consumers hit `Cannot find module '@vui-rs/...'`.

  `publishConfig` is removed; `exports`/`module`/`types` now point at `dist/`
  directly (single source of truth, identical in dev and on npm). Packages must be
  built before running examples or typechecking, so `build:packages` builds in
  dependency order (core → vue → ui → vite-plugin) and `dev:*` / `build:examples`
  run it first.
